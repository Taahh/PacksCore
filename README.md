# PacksNetworkMod
A plugin using Spigot 1.9.2 and Aero (created by Prozza) to form a plugin for the PacksNetwork server.

You may obtain Aero here: www.github.com/Pravian/Aero
Look for a tutorial on how to compile Spigot using BuildTools

<b>You MUST have Aero running on the server that the PacksNetworkMod is running on or else it will not work.
Also be sure that you have Java 8 installed or it will not work</b>
